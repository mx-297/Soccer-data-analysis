# Soccer-data-analysis

# Purpose of analysis
The purpose of this project is to perform data analysis on Soccer database using pandas, sqlite3, and matplotlib to draw conclusions related to the following questions:

1 - What team attributes lead to the most victories?<br>
2 - Which players improved the most in penalties?<br>
3 - Do rightfoot players have more shot accuracy/power than leftfoot players?<br>

# Steps of implementation:
  
   * The sequence of implmenting the analysis was the same as the sequence of the questions i.e performing analysis on each question separately. The following steps           were conducted for each question:
        
        * Gather: This is the first step of any analysis. In this project, gathering means retrieving a specific table or joins of tables into a pandas dataframe.
        * Clean: Cleaning the data from null values and checking for data types consistency.
        * Explore: Performing explanatory data analysis on the dataframes to search the data for answers of the questions.
        * Conclusion: Drawing conclusions about the answers of the specific question and plotting a graph of possible to illustrate the answer graphically.
